## What I learnt
---
Entry point, allows specific blocks of code to be run directly. Allows for testing of modules which can then be used in other scripts by importing.
>if __name__ = '__main__':
---
Shebang specifies which interpreter/application should be used to run specified files
>#!/usr/bin/env python3
>\nTakes python from the environment of the system

In linvux it is possible to make files executable
>chmod +x main.py
>This allows it to be run without specifying python

Windows looks at file extensions, but Linux does not. Files in linux can be handled by shabang in python.
